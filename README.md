@HeartCareConnect

How we came up with this idea?

In UK care homes, most of the deaths,
occurred between 2.am to 8.am.
a period when caregivers may be prone to falling asleepâ€¦
So, to assist the caregivers, 
we create a system that can continuously monitoring the heart signal of the elderly.

If no signal is detected, 
our system will promptly alert the caregivers, 
enabling them to swiftly request medical assistance.
